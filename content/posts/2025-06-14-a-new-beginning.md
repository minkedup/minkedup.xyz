Welcome to my blog! I'm sure you have a bunch of questions so let me answer
them.

#### Stack?

Ah yes, the question that everyone who makes a blog is compelled to answer - but
especially so for those who roll their own. However, I decided not to roll my
own static site generator despite the create-a-new-project devil on my shoulder
screaming at me to.

I chose [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) for the static site generator with [Pico
CSS](https://picocss.com/) for the CSS framework. I didn't really have a
preference for the static site generator so I just picked the fastest well-used
option that I could find. I don't really have a rationale for picking Pico CSS
other than it looks good and it's the first thing that I came across (also, I
really do not want to hand-roll CSS).

#### Why?

Because I like writing about technical subjects! The most important thing that
anyone can realize is that knowledge is intersectional - this is especially true
when it comes to computing. I've been the benefactor of so many technical blogs
delving into and touching on different subjects, so I thought I'd try my hand at
giving back to that for a change.

#### What's Next

Not sure! I have an idea cooking for an upcoming post but I'm not sure when I'll
publish it.

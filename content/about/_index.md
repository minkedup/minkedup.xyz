title: About Me
---

I'm a hobbyist programmer and Software Engineering student at the [Rochester
Institute of Technology](https://rit.edu). I plan on graduating with a degree in
Software Engeering at the end of this upcoming Fall semester (Fall '25).

I recently completed a Co-Op at [More Vang](https://morevang.com/) working as a
Programmer in Alexendria, VA.

Before that I had a Co-Op working at [Xylem](https://www.xylem.com/) as a
Research and Development Intern in Seneca Falls, NY.

title: About Me
---

I'm a hobbyist programmer and Software Engineering student going into my senior
year next spring semester (spring '25). I attend college at the [Rochester
Institute of Technology](https://rit.edu).

I recently completed a Co-Op at [More Vang](https://morevang.com/) working as a
Programmer in Alexendria, VA.

Before that I had a Co-Op working at [Xylem](https://www.xylem.com/) as a
Research and Development Intern in Seneca Falls, NY.
